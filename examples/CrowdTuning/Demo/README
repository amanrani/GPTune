This directory contains two crowd-tuning examples.

================================================================================

Example 1. Transfer learning-based autotuning of synthetic demo functions using
pre-collected data.

This crowd-tuning example tunes synthetic task functions using performance data
(collected for a different task value) from our crowd-tuning repository at
https://gptune.lbl.gov/repo/dashboard.

Note that, our crowd-tuning requires users to provide an API key. Users can
obtain an API key here (sign-up and log-in required)
https://gptune.lbl.gov/account/access-tokens

Users can run the prepared experiment as follows.

Step 1. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the tuning script

$ source CROWDTUNING_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 2. Run a prepared script that evaluates crowd-based tuning and
tuning without using our crowd-database.

(a) Mac
$ ./run_experiments_mac.sh

(b) Linux (our docker image)
$ ./run_experiments_linux.sh

Step 3. Generate plots to compare different tuning options.

$ source env.sh
$ python analyze_time_solution.py

Users can refer to these scripts run_experiments_mac/linux.sh and demo_tuning.py
to apply the crowd-tuning approach to users' tuning problems.

================================================================================

Example 2. Tutorial of automatic uploading of function evaluations.

This example tunes the synthetic demo function and automatically uploads the
obtained function evaluation results to the history database shared repository.

Step 1. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the tuning script

$ source CROWDTUNING_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 2. Run a prepared script. This will upload the obtained function
evaluations to the history database shared repository.

(a) Mac
$ ./run_experiments_mac.sh

(b) Linux (our docker image)
$ ./run_experiments_linux.sh

You can access the history database repository and see uploaded performance data
using a web browser. Please access https://gptune.lbl.gov/repo/dashboard and
search data for "Demo-Tutorial".
