# Hypre Example.

There are prepared experiment scripts for crowd-tuning of Hypre.

The experiemnts assume NERSC's Cori machine using 1 Haswell node. If the user
has no access to NERSC's Cori machine, or if the user needs to use a different
number or a different type of compute nodes, the user should modify the related
scripts. The user might need to update Hypre files for a different
software configuration setting.

Note that, our crowd-tuning API requires users to provide an API key. Users can
obtain an API key here (sign-up and log-in required)

# Experiment 1. Run a Sobol sensitivity analysis using performance data in our
repository.

Step 1. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the script

$ source CROWDTUNING_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 2. Export crowd-tuning API and GPTune package links

$ source env.sh

Step 3. Run the prepared script.

$ python ./sensitivity_analysis.py

# Experiment 2. Comparing tuning on 12 parameters (the original tuning space) and
tuning on 3 parameters (reduced based on Sobol analysis).

Step 1. Allocate a compute node to run the experiment.

Step 2. Export your crowd-tuning API key to be used by the script

$ source CROWDTUNING_API_KEY="your_api_key"

Step 3. Run the prepared script.

$ ./run_examples.sh

Step 4. Generate plots to compare different tuning options.

$ python analyze_tuning_result.py
